                    These posters were sent in a competition from my University years.
                    In this competition we had to pass through the message about violence against Women.
                    I wanted to lure the victims and people to stand up and stop the violence against innocent women by
                    bringing awareness.In this poster I wanted to show that victims can become like puppets in the
                    hands of their violators. Victims loose their voice, their will and they hide their problems and
                    sadness from the rest of the word with the fear of being judged or get more harm from their violator.
                    I used textures, images, illustration collages and my handmade typeface.
