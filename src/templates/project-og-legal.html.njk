                    O.G Legal is a new law company that requested from the company I used to work to create their brand
                    and that includes the logo, website and business cards. Even thought the client requested for a more
                    oriental approach I managed to convince them with my logo ideas for a more appropriate branding that
                    suites a law company. In this logo selection I wanted to pass though an elegant and modern style,
                    but at the same time to give the feeling of professionalism and trust.
