                    After the new brand identity of Rik the company I used to work was assigned to design a new website.
                    In this website I had the task to make a simple website with modern style and most importantly a user
                    friendly navigation.Because the target audience of Rik includes older ages as well, I had to made
                    the designs as clean and simple as possible.
